CAPSTONE SOLUTION:

The RentApp software application will help the client by targeting the role of the office administrator. Specifically, the task scheduling of appointments is largely dependent on handwritten notes, hard-copy calendars, manual time-zone calculations, and email communications. Not only are there multiple ways to err in this task as it is repeated with several appointments, but it will continue to increase exponentially as more properties are available to rent.

The RentApp application will relieve the office administratorâ€™s responsibilities of making those calculations and will simultaneously speed up the process. The database interface application will provide automatic time-zone conversions, overlap validations, and assign contacts with a few clicks of the button. This will cut down costs in terms of time and increase effectiveness of crucial value-based communications.
